![YieldLayer Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/8b5cf6/ffffff?text=YieldLayer+-+Auto-Compounding+DeFi+Yields)

**Tagline:** Auto-compounding DeFi yields on X Layer with OKB rewards

## üöÄ Overview

YieldLayer is an automated yield optimization platform that maximizes returns across OKX DEX, lending protocols, and liquidity pools on X Layer with intelligent rebalancing and auto-compounding. Built specifically for X Layer's low gas costs and fast finality.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üîÑ Multi-Protocol Auto-Rebalancer
- Continuously monitors yields across OKX DEX pools, X Layer lending protocols (Aave, Compound forks), and staking opportunities
- Automatically shifts capital to highest-yield strategies every 6 hours or when yield delta exceeds 2%
- **X Layer Optimization:** ~$0.001 per rebalance enables frequent rebalancing that would be cost-prohibitive on Ethereum mainnet

### ‚ö° Smart Auto-Compounding Engine
- Harvests rewards from farms, pools, and OKB staking every 24 hours
- Automatically swaps rewards to base assets via OKX DEX and reinvests into highest-performing vault strategies
- **Benefit:** Increases APY by 20-35% vs manual farming with daily harvests costing less than $0.01

### üõ°Ô∏è OKB Stable Yield Vaults
- Conservative strategies focused on USDT/USDC lending on X Layer and OKB single-sided staking
- Target 8-15% APY with <5% maximum drawdown
- Real-time risk monitoring pauses strategies if volatility exceeds thresholds

### üìà Leveraged OKX Ecosystem Plays
- Advanced strategies using OKX DEX flash loans for leverage
- Delta-neutral farming (long spot + short perps)
- Arbitrage between OKX DEX and OKX CEX
- Target 25-50% APY with higher risk disclosure

### üìä Real-Time Yield Dashboard
- Live APY tracking across all vaults
- Historical performance charts
- Gas cost savings vs Ethereum
- Projected earnings calculator
- One-click deposit/withdraw with OKX Wallet integration

### üö® Emergency Exit System
- One-click withdrawal from all positions with priority processing
- Automatic circuit breakers pause deposits if vault APY drops >50%
- **X Layer Advantage:** True instant withdrawals (2s finality) vs 15-minute delays on other L2s

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
